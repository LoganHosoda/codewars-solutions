// An AI has infected a text with a character!!
// 
// This text is now fully mutated to this character.
// 
// Starting with the original text, and given a character, return the text once it has been mutated so that all of the characters in the original text have been replaced with the character.
// 
// If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.
// There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!
// 
// Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.
// 
// Example
// text before = "abc"
// character   = "z"
// text after  = "zzz"
// 
// SOLUTION

function contamination(text, char){
  if (text.length == 0 || char.length == 0) return "";
  const ans = char.repeat(text.length);
  return text = ans;
